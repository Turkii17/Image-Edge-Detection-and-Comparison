# Image-Edge-Detection-and-Comparison

This repository contains Python code for image processing and edge detection using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The code aims to demonstrate edge detection techniques on two sets of  images:

# Images
Alhambra_-Palacio_Carlos_V.-_South and Lion's Lobby

Load images, convert to RGB, and display in grayscale.
Apply Canny edge detection with different threshold values.
Visualize the results with vertical lines indicating points of interest.
Ambassador's Lobby and Basil Lobby

Load and process lobby images, converting them to grayscale.
Apply Canny edge detection with customized threshold values.
Visualize the edge-detected images with marked points of interest.


# Results and Observations
The README provides insights into the edge detection process, highlighting specific points of interest in the images. Users can refer to the visualizations to understand how different threshold values impact the edge detection outcome.
